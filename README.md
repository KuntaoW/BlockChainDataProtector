Use Block Chain to Protect you data not been changed

For example we have data as following :

Id	uid	amount	fromUid	txTime
834	101	50.50	  88	    01/05/2020
835	101	100	    88	    03/05/2020
836	101	80.55  	88	    05/05/2020

The records shows there are 3 transactions from user (fromUid) 88 to user (uid) 101, amount are $50.50,$100 and $80.55
How could we make sure the records especially the amount not been changed?
